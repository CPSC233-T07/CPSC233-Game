#  Hello!
#   This is the Readme for our master branch. 
#   Short debrief on our team git, so far ive only made 2 branches (master & Readme-edits) soon more will be added as needed. 

#   The idea of the git is 
#   1. Work on any branch that isnt the master branch
#   2. Once you finish working on it create a pull request which lets you compare all the differences between the master branch and yours
#   3. Confirm your pull request and the your branch will be merged into the master branch

#   Anytime you make a chnage to any branche Github typically requires your "Commit Changes". It doesnt need to be precise or detailed just a short sentence explaining your changes like "Updated Readme file"
